Debugging this type of error requires a systematic approach:

1. **Examine Native Build Logs:**  The most crucial step is to carefully examine the complete native build logs (Android's `gradlew` output or Xcode's build log).  Look for specific error messages, warnings, or missing dependencies.
2. **Simplify the Project:**  If possible, create a minimal reproducible example.  Temporarily remove custom native modules or other potentially problematic parts of your project to isolate the cause of the issue.
3. **Check Native Module Compatibility:**  Ensure all your native modules are compatible with each other and with the Expo SDK version you're using.
4. **Verify Build Configurations:**  Review your Android Gradle configuration (`android/build.gradle`, `android/app/build.gradle`) and Xcode build settings to ensure everything is correctly set up. 
5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning the build directory (e.g., `./gradlew clean` for Android) and performing a fresh build.
6. **Check Disk Space:**  Ensure you have enough disk space on your build machine.
7. **Update Build Tools:**  Make sure your build tools (Android SDK, Xcode, Node.js) are up-to-date.
8. **Use Expo Diagnostics:** Run `expo diagnostics` to identify potential problems with your environment.

The provided `expoBug.js` file contains a simulated scenario where a missing native dependency could cause such an error. The solution involves identifying and resolving such dependency conflicts.
