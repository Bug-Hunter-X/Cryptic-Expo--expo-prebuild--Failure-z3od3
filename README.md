# Cryptic Expo `expo prebuild` Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered during the `expo prebuild` process. The problem manifests as a cryptic error message from the native build system (Android or iOS), making diagnosis difficult.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo prebuild`.

The `expo prebuild` command will likely fail with a vague or unhelpful error message.  To aid in debugging, the Android build logs and/or Xcode build logs (depending on your target platform) should be examined for further clues.

## Solution

The solution typically involves careful examination of the native build logs.  Common causes include:

* **Native Module Conflicts:**  Incompatible versions or conflicting dependencies among native modules.
* **Incorrect Native Code:**  Errors or inconsistencies in custom native code.
* **Build Configuration Issues:**  Problems with Android Gradle configurations or Xcode build settings.
* **Missing Dependencies:**  Missing native dependencies required by your project.
* **Environment Issues:**  Problems with the build environment, such as insufficient disk space or incorrect toolchain setup.

The `expoBugSolution.js` file contains strategies for debugging and resolving these types of issues.
